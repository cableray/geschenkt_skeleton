# Geschenkt

No Thanks! is a card game for three to five players. Originally called Geschenkt! (presented (as a gift) in German)

## Rules

- There are playing cards numbered 3 to 35 in the game
  - at the beginning of the game, nine random cards are removed from the deck
- Each player receives 11 chips
- The first player flips over the top card and either:
  - takes it (earning him points according to the value) or 
  - passes on the card by paying a chip (placing it on the card)
- If a player takes a card, he/she also:
  - takes all chips that have been put on the card
  - flips over the next card and decides if he/she wants it
- play continues until all cards have been taken

##Scoring

At the end of the game, cards give points according to their value, but cards in a row only count as a single card 
with the lowest value (e.g. A run of 30, 29, 28, 27 is only worth 27 points.) Chips are worth one negative point each. 
The player(s) with the lowest number of points win the game.

##Goals for Code Retreat

- Build a playable version of this game that can be played with human players
- Add an AI to play against
